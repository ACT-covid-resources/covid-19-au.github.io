## Call for features
We receive tons of features requests from users and like the following features most:
* Display the view number in the top-right of our homepage by retrieving the number from our Google Analytics
* Need better interavtive visualization for showing historical data trend
* Nice UI for the flight search 
* Multi-lingual site development. As not everyone in AU is proficient in English, we hope that users can switch to their native language when using our site.
* A dedicated page for nice intreactive visualization for our data including age, gender, suburb distribution of confirmred cases, increasing number in each state, ICU beds in each hospital, etc.

If you are interested in one or more of these features, you are welcome to submit a PR and we will review it.
Once your PR is merged, we will list you in the contributor list of this project.
Looking forward to your work. **Note**: Please make sure that if you do submit a pull request, that it is to the 'dev' branch.
