            "content":"<p>When facing a pandemic such as COVID-19, it is essential for medical professionals to have adequate supply of vital defence gear to protect them from the droplets that spread the virus. However, there has been a shortage of gowns, goggles, shields, and gloves, especially in the Bendigo area.</p><p>Doctors desperate for supplies have resorted to making their own gowns in order to continue to treat those in critical need.</p><p>Luckily, nearly 300 Bendigo locals and small businesses have volunteered to help fund, cut and sew homemade protective gowns for doctors to allow them to continue their life saving efforts.</p><p>A massive thank you to these selfless and generous individuals who are doing what they can to help health professionals to continue to treat their patients. You are a great example to how Australians can still unite and contribute to help combat the outbreak during self-isolation at home. Extraordinary work Australia!</p><p>If you know how to sew or would like to donate materials please contact gownsfordoctors@gmail.com!</p>",
